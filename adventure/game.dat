>environ>Office
>description>You stand inside of a glum cubicle farm, the air thick with the smell of acrid coffee. You pause for a moment and think, "Where's Maduka?" You figure he must be off somewhere teaching or something.

~Room
>id>1001
>name>Gilbert Hall, 3rd Floor
>environ>Hallway
>description>You stand in the hallway at the south end of Gilbert. To the east is the breezeway to the annex. Undergrads block the hallway to the north. It appears the little punks are sitting on the floor while they're waiting for someone's office hours. The south door to the stairwell appears to be stuck. Perhaps someone should call facilities?

>name>Breezeway to Chem Annex
>environ>Hallway
>description>You stand in a breezeway that used to connect Gilbert hall to the Chemistry Annex. However, it would seem that shoddy construction has taken its toll - the breezeway is collapsed to the east, barring further progression.
